    <h1 style="color:black" align="center">TERM AND CONDITIONS</h1>
	<p style="background-color:white">The RENT-A-LOVER website is a web developed by Kago Kevin Malokwane Sianang, inspierd by the shown anime "RentA-Girlfriend" and Japanese pop culture
	as a way to help people find comfort in new love and help people connect and socialize during their hardest moments.Having a girlfriend entails shouting, quarreling, and nagging, as well as shelling out cash on pricey dinners
	and excursions and giving up some of your solitude. When you rent a girlfriend, 
	you do away with all of these drawbacks and replace them with simply the advantages of having a partner—with the exception of any sexual
	components because it's against the law to trade sexual favors for cash or commodities. </p>
	 
		<p style="background-color:white" >By Agreeing to use this website you agree to the following terms and conditions</p>
	<p style="background-color:white">1.Confirm that you are above the age of 18</p>
	<p style="background-color:white" >2.Respect our workers and refrain from harassment</p>

<p style="background-color: white"> Will I Get the “Lover Experience?”.</p>
<p style="background-color:white">Be extremely explicit with me. Only platonic friendships are permitted with the Friends that are offered 
for hire on RentAFriend. All of the girlfriends available for hire on RentAFriend.com are platonic. They don't provide any tangible services.
 No sexual activity, touching, kissing, etc. Everything that happens has to be platonic in nature..</p>
<p style="background-color:white">How Much Does it Cost to Rent a Lover?</p>
<p style="background-color:white">The girlfriends offered for rent on RentALover.com start at just $10 per hour, but depending on the occasion, activity, etc., many are adjustable or ready to forgo their price. For instance, you will probably have to cover the friend's costs if you want them to join you at a business event,
 a wedding, a party, etc. However, many of the buddies may think twice about lowering,
 if not completely waiving, their cost if you have tickets to the hottest concert, athletic event, or other special event.</p>
